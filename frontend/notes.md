# Bible App frontend

## TO DO:
### Important
- detect cursor highlighting and from where it starts and end
- put span tags with default color over all p tags (and different divs)
- create highlight pop up (little thing that shows up to select the color and write text)
- display popup on click release

### Secondary
- anonymous user storage (localstorage)
- registered user storage (fetch req -> server database)
- show meta data about book reading 
- navigation menu (dropdown)
- fetch verses on page load (done in last because of need to have server up)
